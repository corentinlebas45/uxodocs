# Create

The CLM can be used to create a scope from a [template](broken-link.md) using the `create` job.  

```properties
<clm> create --template=<template> --scope=<scope> --admin=<admin>
```
<br/>
__Parameters:__

| Parameter       | Description                                                                |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| template        | Template identifier (name of the folder in which it is located)            |
| scope           | Identifier of the scope to be created                                      |
| admin           | Name of the user who owns the new scope                                    |
| ws.url          | The FlowerDocs CORE url. Example : localhost:8081/core/services            |
| user            | The admin account ID                                                       |
| password        | The password for the admin account                                         |

# Delete

To delete a scope, you can use the ``delete`` job, such as: 

```properties
<clm> delete --scope=<scope>
```

# Reset

Jobs can be merged; resetting a scope can be done using the `delete` and `create` jobs: 

```properties
<clm> delete create --template=<template> --scope=<scope>
```
	
# Update

The ``update`` job is used to update an existing scope.

* Components present in the template but absent from the initial scope will be added.
* Components that differ from the initial scope will be updated.
* Documents present in the initial scope but absent from the template will not be deleted.

This job can be used, for example, to update a scope's configuration without deleting existing documents.

The update can proceed even if the template doesn't include a scope.xml file. In this case, objects that may be configured in this file, as teams, and which have been created after the scope initialisation will not be removed.

<br/>
__Example:__ Update ``HR`` scope

```properties
<clm> update --template=simple --scope=HR
```

There are also more specific update jobs. These allow you to update only a certain type of configuration.

| Job                    | Description                                                                                    |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| update-config          | Updating configuration files                                                 |
| update-model           | Update component classes, tags, categories and workflow                      |
| update-content         | Updating content (documents, folders, virtual folders and tasks)             |
| update-scope           | Update scope.xml file (which manages ACLs, display names, scope teams, etc.) |

# Export

A scope can be exported using the ``export`` job. This job creates a template from an existing scope.

```properties
<clm> export --scope=<scope> --template=<template>
```

<br/>
__Parameters:__

| Parameter       | Description                                                                |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| scope           | Identifier of the scope to be exported                                     |
| template        | Identifier of the template to be created (name of the folder in which it is located) |
| ws.url          | The FlowerDocs CORE url. Example : localhost:8081/core/services            |
| user            | The admin account ID                                                       |
| password        | The password for the admin account                                         |

By default, the scope will be exported to a ``data`` folder in the runtime directory.

To change the directory where the export will be stored, add the `` --data.dir=<chemin>`` parameter to the command ``<clm>``

<br/>
There are also more specific export jobs. 

| Job                    | Description                                                                  |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| export-config          | Export configuration files                                                   |
| export-model           | Export component classes, tags, categories and workflow                      |
| export-content         | Export content (documents, folders, virtual folders and tasks)               |
| export-scope           | Export scope.xml file (which manages ACLs, display names, scope teams, etc.) |
| export-annotations     | Export document's annotations                                                |

:::warning
The ``export`` or ``export-config`` jobs do not get annotations. Only the ``export-annotations`` job export it.
Before version 2025.2.0, annotations were exported by ``export-config`` job.
