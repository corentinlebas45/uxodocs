:::info
The ``force`` parameter is used to determine the behaviour to adopt in the event of conflicts between elements in several modules:

 * true: elements present in a module overwrite elements in the initial scope
 * false (default): elements present in a module are ignored if they are present in the initial scope.

The order followed is the order passed as input to the CLM.
:::

# Execution 

The CLM offers the option of merging several scopes.

```properties
<clm> merge --template=<template> --modules=<module1>,<module2>
```

# Merge rules

Generally speaking, merge follows the following rules:

 * If an element is present in one scope and absent in another, it will be present in the merged scope
 * If an element is present in several scopes:
    * Some sub-elements are merged (see detailed rules below)
    * Other properties are either ignored or overwritten if defined, depending on the value of the ``force`` parameter.

## Scope 

Merge of data in the ``scope.xml`` file. 

The merge is performed as follows:

 * If a profile is present in several modules, the list of identities and properties is merged
 * 2 properties with the same name but different values are seen as different objects


## ACLs

 * The list of entries is merged
 * In the case of proxy ACLs: the list of proxy ACLs is merged. If a proxy ACL is present in several modules, it is ignored or overwritten depending on the value of the ``force`` parameter

## Component classes

 * The list of tag references and tag categories are merged
 * If a tag reference is present for the same class in several modules, it is ignored or overwritten depending on the value of the ``force`` parameter 

### Task classes

 * The list of attachments and replies are merged
 * If an attachment is present for a class in several modules, it is ignored or overwritten depending on the value of the ``force`` parameter 
 * If a response is present for a class in several modules, it is ignored or overwritten depending on the value of the ``force`` parameter 

### Folder classes

 * The list of attachments is merged
 * If an attachment is present for a class in several modules, it is ignored or overwritten depending on the value of the ``force`` parameter 

### Virtual folder classes

 * The search list is merged
 * If a search is present for a class in several modules, it is ignored or overwritten depending on the value of the ``force`` parameter 

## Tag classes

 * If a "Choice list" tag class is present in several modules, the lists of values are merged 
 * Conditional value lists are not merged.

## Components

 * The tag list is merged
 * If a tag is present for the same component in several modules, its value is ignored or overwritten depending on the value of the ``force`` parameter 


### Documents

 * If a document is present in several modules, its content is ignored or overwritten depending on the value of the ``force`` parameter

### Folders

 * If a folder is present in several modules, the list of attachments is merged

### Tasks

 * If a task is present in several modules, the lists of attachments and participants are merged

## Tag categories

 * If a profile is present in several modules, the list of identities and properties is merged

## Process

 * If a process is present in several modules, the list of classes is merged
 * Other process properties, such as the first step, are ignored or overwritten depending on the value of the ``force`` parameter

## Facts

 * The list of facts is merged
 * If a fact is present in several modules, it is ignored or overwritten depending on the value of the ``force`` parameter
 
# Example 

The GEC scope contains a ``MailToBeProcessed`` task class with an ``Incoming mail`` attachment. The icon property is set to ``icon_A``.

The OutgoingMail scope contains a ``MailToBeProcessed`` task class with an ``outgoing mail`` attachment. The icon property is set to ``icon_B``.

<br/>

The merge is performed in GEC-OutgoingMail order. 

<br/>

In all cases, the ``MailToBeProcessed`` class will have ``Incoming mail`` and ``Outgoing mail`` as attachments, because the list of attachments is merged.

If the ``force`` parameter is ``false``, the icon will be set to ``icon_A``

If the ``force`` parameter is ``true``, the icon will be set to ``icon_B``
