# Execution



The CLM is an executable JAR and can be run with a command like: 

```properties
java -jar flower-docs-clm-2025.2.0-bundle.jar
```

To interact with FlowerDocs, you need to define the URL for accessing web services, as well as login details: 

```properties
java -jar flower-docs-clm-2025.2.0-bundle.jar --ws.url=http://<server>:<port>/<context>/services	--password=<password>
```

*The default user name is `system`, which can be changed by adding the `--USER=<user>` parameter.*
 
 <br/>

The `clm.batch.size=1` parameter sets the batch size for processing jobs in CLM. It can prove useful for resolving conflict issues during updates, as it ensures that each operation is processed individually, thus preventing concurrency errors.

<br/>

**Usage example :**
```properties
java -jar flower-docs-clm-2025.2.0-bundle.jar update --ws.url=http://<server>:<port>/<context>/services --clm.batch.size=1 [â€¦]
```
