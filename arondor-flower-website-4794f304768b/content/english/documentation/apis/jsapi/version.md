A naming strategy defines the labels that users can enter when creating a document version. Different strategies are available: 

* `MINOR`:  MINOR version only. 
* `MAJOR`  : MAJOR version only.
* `NUMBERED`: MINOR and MAJOR versions.
* `CUSTOM` : Custom label only.
* `ALL` : Three strategies are offered to the user: MINOR, MAJOR and CUSTOM.
* `NONE` : No strategy, no promotional action displayed.

<br/>
By default, the `ALL` strategy is applied. The Javascript API can be used to restrict the naming strategies offered to users: 

```javascript 
var versioningAPI = JSAPI.get().getVersioningAPI();
versioningAPI.register(function (component,callback) {
        callback.onSuccess("CUSTOM");
      });
```
Several resolvers can be defined, but the first valid value is used as the naming strategy.
:::info
Version numbers are automatically suggested from the previous version label. 

* So if the previous version is 1.0, then for a minor version 1.1 will be proposed, and 2.0 for a major one. 
* If for the previous version, the label is customized (noted: xxx) then the proposed labels will be xxx**_0.1** for a minor version and xxx**_1.0** for a major version.
