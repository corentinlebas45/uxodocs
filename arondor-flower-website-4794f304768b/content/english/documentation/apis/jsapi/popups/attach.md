This section describes the possible interactions with the widget called ``ComponentAttacher`` which allows you to attach a component to a folder.

This type of popup cannot be created manually, but it is possible to subscribe to its opening in the following way: 

```javascript
JSAPI.get().getPopupAPI().registerForComponentAttacherOpen(function(popup){
	popup.setTitle("My new title");
	popup.setRapidSearchVisible(false); 
	popup.getActions().get("advancedSearch").setEnabled(false); 
});  
```
Properties that can be modified on other popup types can also be modified on this one. The following functions are specific to this type of popup: 


| Property                                            | Description                                                                    |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| setRapidSearchVisible(boolean visible)                | Quick search visibility                                              |        
| setSearchTemplate(String searchTemplate)              | Defining the search form used for advanced search           |        
| attach(Folder folder)                                 | Attaches the current component to a folder                                      |        
| getActions()                                          | Allows to retrieve the corresponding ActionSetAPI, to manipulate the various actions present.|        


The actions available via the ``getActions()`` method are: 

* ``browseFolder``: Browse folder tree
* ``advancedSearch``: Advanced search
* ``newFolder``: Creating a new folder 

<br/>

The popup displayed when the action is clicked ``browseFolder`` will display a folder tree. It's possible that for some requirements the complete tree structure won't meet your needs, and that a certain part of the tree structure 
is authorised for an `attachment`. In this case, you can restrict the display of the various folders in this tree structure as follows: 


```javascript
folderAttacher = JSAPI.get().getPopupAPI().getFolderAttacher();
folderAttacher.register(function(folder,toAttach, callback){
	if(folder.getName() == "2014"){
    	console.error("Remove item " + folder.getName() + " from browse tree");
		callback.onSuccess(null);
	}
	else if(folder.getName() == "Arondor"){
		console.log("Force disable selection for "+ folder.getName());
		callback.onSuccess(new SelectableTreeItem(folder.getName(),false));
    }
	else{
		console.log("Use applicative selection for "+ folder.getName());
		callback.onSuccess(new SelectableTreeItem(folder.getName());
	}
});
```

In the example above, the component with the name *Arondor* will be displayed, but not selectable. The one with the name *2014* will not be displayed and the others will be. 
<br/>
In the latter case, the selection used is the one calculated by the application, i.e it's only displayed if the current component class is in the folder's list of authorised children.
