# "Managing buckets"

The buckets (or aggregated results) of a search can be organised using the JS API.

## Subscription

The first step, before being able to manipulate these buckets, is to subscribe to buckets retrieval from FlowerDocs Core:

* or by search, providing `searchId` the identifier of the search in question: 

```javascript
var bucketAPI = JSAPI.get().getHelperFactory().getBucketAPI();
bucketAPI.register(searchId, function(buckets, callback){
	callback.onProcessed(buckets);
});
```

* or for all searches:

```javascript
var bucketAPI = JSAPI.get().getHelperFactory().getBucketAPI();
bucketAPI.register(, function(buckets, callback){
	callback.onProcessed(buckets);
});
```

The registered subscription is called up with two variables: 

* The `buckets` array contains all buckets of the same level 
* The `callback` provided as input to the subscription must be called with a bucket array  

```javascript
var orderMap = {};
orderMap[STATUS_1] = 0;
orderMap[STATUS_2] = 1;

var bucketAPI = JSAPI.get().getHelperFactory().getBucketAPI();
bucketAPI.register("searchId", function(buckets, callback){
    var ordered = new Array();
	for(i in buckets){
		var bucket = buckets[i];
		var index = getBucketIndex(bucket);
        var bucket = buckets[i];
    }
	callback.onProcessed(ordered);
});

function getBucketIndex(bucket){
	var request = bucket.getRequest();
    var filter = request.getFilters()[0];
    var statusName = filter.getCriteria()[0].getValues()[0];
	return orderMap[statusName];
}
```

:::info
Deleting or adding buckets is not supported. The total number of buckets determined must be equal to that determined by FlowerDocs Core.

## Bucket modification

The JS API lets you modify buckets resolved by FlowerDocs Core by exhibiting the following methods: 

|Function|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|getName()|Returns the name|
|setName(name)|Modifies the name|
|getCount()|Returns the number of components contained in the bucket (sum of child buckets)|
|setCount(long count)|Modifies the number of components contained in the bucket|
|getLevel()|Returns bucket level|
|hasChildren()|Determines whether the bucket contains child buckets|
|getChildren()|Retrieves child buckets|
|hasParent()|Determines whether the bucket has a bucket parent|
|getParents()|Retrieves parent buckets (all parent levels)|
|getRequest()|Retrieves the request executed to determine the bucket's contents|
|setRequest(SearchRequest request)|Modifies the request executed to determine the bucket's contents|

:::info
Children and parents buckets are provided for information only. Modifications to these are not taken into account.
:::


## Hiding a bucket

The `setSkipDisplay(boolean skip)` function is also exhibited on the `Bucket` object, enabling a bucket to be hidden and only its children displayed.


```javascript
var bucketAPI = JSAPI.get().getHelperFactory().getBucketAPI();
bucketAPI.register(function(buckets, callback){
	var ordered = new Array();
	for(i in buckets){
		var bucket = buckets[i];			
		if(bucket.hasChildren() && bucket.getChildren().length ==1){
			if(bucket.getName().toUpperCase() == bucket.getChildren()[0].getName().toUpperCase()){
				bucket.setSkipDisplay(true);
			}
		}	
		ordered.push(bucket);	
	}
	callback.onProcessed(ordered);	
});
```

# Recovery of buckets after resolution

The buckets of a search can be recovered after resolution as follows: 

```javascript
var bucketAPI = JSAPI.get().getHelperFactory().getBucketAPI();
bucketAPI.registerForResolved("searchId", function(buckets){
   for(i in buckets){
       	var bucket = buckets[i];
		console.info(bucket.getName()+ " has been resolved, count=" +bucket.getCount());
   }
   callback.onProcessed(buckets);
});
```

This allows you to obtain resolved buckets, including counters in the case of partial buckets.
