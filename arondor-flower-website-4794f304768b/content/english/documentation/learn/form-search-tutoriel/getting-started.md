# Goals

The aim of searches is to provide business users with tools tailored to their needs. All the essential information will be at your fingertips.

</br>

In this tutorial, we will create an example of a **Client folder search**. This will simply display client folders with their reference, surname and first name.

# Definitions
Search forms are pre-configured search templates, which are then made available to end users.

A search has two main parts: firstly, the search form, which allows you to create a query containing your search criteria, and secondly, the search results, which are displayed afterwards.
