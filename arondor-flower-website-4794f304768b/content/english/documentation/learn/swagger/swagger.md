# Goal
The aim of this module is to give you the keys to getting to grips with and using Swagger UI to consume the REST web services exposed by FlowerDocs Core.

# Access 

Swagger UI is available from FlowerDocs Core at `/swagger-ui/index.html`.
For example, for an online demonstration, Swagger UI is available [here](https://flowerdocs.com/core/swagger-ui/index.html).

# Authentication

The services exposed by FlowerDocs Core require the client to be authenticated, so it is necessary to provide a token for requests executed from Swagger UI.

We will start by generating a user token : 

* In the menu bar, select the `Authentication` specification 
* Select the `authentication-rest-controller` web service 
* Unfold the endpoint ``POST /rest/authentication``
* Click on ``Try it out`` 
* In the request editor, fill in the ``password``, ``scope`` and ``user`` fields 

If the information entered is correct, the HTTP response section shows: 

* a return code 200
* a JSON token object with its text value and expiry date


Then, to authenticate future requests: 

* Copy and paste the text value of the generated token (``value`` field)
* Click on the ``Authorize`` button 
* Paste the copied token 

Future requests will provide FlowerDocs Core with the defined token to authenticate them.

# My first request

In this section, we will test our first request using Swagger UI.
This request will search for all documents whose name contains the letter ``a``.

* In the menu bar, select the `Component` specification 
* Select the `document-rest-controller` web service 
* Unfold the endpoint ``POST /rest/documents/search``
* Click on ``Try it out`` 
* In the request editor, copy and paste the following request: 


```javascript
{
    "filterClauses": [{
        "criteria": [{
            "name": "name",
            "operator": "CONTAINS",
            "type": "STRING",
            "values": ["a"]
        }]
    }],
    "max": 10
}
```


To execute the search, click on the ``Execute`` button and consult the results found in the section presenting the HTTP response.
