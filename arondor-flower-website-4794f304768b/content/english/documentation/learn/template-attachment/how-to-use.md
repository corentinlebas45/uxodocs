# Goal

In this section, we will look at how to use the plugin configured in the previous step.  

# Prerequisites

To use `TemplateAttachmentPlugin`, you need to have completed the steps in the previous section.

# Choice of document template

First of all, you need to have a `GEC_Step2_ToBeProcessed` task assigned to you. If it does not already have a document attached to the `Response` attachment, then you will see the following icon appear in the area provided for the attachment:

{{< img src="/img/documentation/learn/TemplateAttachmentPluginIcon.PNG" title="Icône de création de document word" class="blog-post-img-auto">}}


You will then have a choice of templates. Select the template that meets your needs, then confirm your choice.

# Modifying a document in Microsoft Word

When you validate the desired document template, a new folder is created in FlowerDocs. The content of this is a file in Word format generated according to the selected template.

The only thing left to do is to save the task or apply a reply to it for the attachment to be taken into account.
