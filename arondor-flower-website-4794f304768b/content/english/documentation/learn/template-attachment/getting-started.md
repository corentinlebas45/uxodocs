# Goal

This module explains how to configure the plugin for generating a document from a template. We will then look at how to use it to generate an attachment from a template in FlowerDocs. We will also see how this attachment can be edited directly in Word.  
When you have finished this module, you will be able to:

* configure the creation of documents from a template,
* use this system to create context-specific attachments.
