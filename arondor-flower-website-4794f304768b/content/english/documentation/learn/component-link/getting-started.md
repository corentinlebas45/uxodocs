# Goal

When you have completed this training module, you will be able to link one component to another using the `LinkFreeListPlugin` plugin.

# An example in practice

The example in this module is based on a job application. For application management, it is important that the application references the job offer, so that the purpose of the application can be determined.

<br/>
Using this plugin, you can use a list of values ( `FREE_LIST ` tag) to:

* browse all job offers to select the one that matches your requirements,
* access the referenced job offer at any time via an icon.



# Data model

To put the example into practice, the following model is required.

## The job offer

The starting point for this example, the job offer is a `JobOffer` class task with the following mandatory tags: 

* `RH_Service`: list of services concerned
* `RH_Job`: list of job types


## The application

The application is an `ApplicationSubmission` class task with the `Lookup` type `RH_OfferLink` tag used to store the link to the job offer to which the candidate is applying.
