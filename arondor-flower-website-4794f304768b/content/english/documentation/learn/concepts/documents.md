# Document content

A document is a component in its own right, with the distinctive feature of having one or more contents. It is therefore a component with a set of tags (or metadata) and a set of content (or files).

<br/>
These contents can be viewed in the  [ARender](https://arender.io/) document viewer.

# Document permissions

In order to restrict access to, or modifications of, a document's content, a number of permissions are available to control possible operations: 

* View content: `READ_CONTENT`
* Add or delete document content: `UPDATE_CONTENT`
* Download document content: `DOWNLOAD_CONTENT`
* Enable printing in the viewer: `PRINT`
* View document annotations: `READ_ANNOTATION`
* Annotate document content: `CREATE_ANNOTATION`
* Document composition: `BUILD_NEW_DOCUMENT`
