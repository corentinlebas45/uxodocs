To validate the correct operation of what has been set up, start by creating a customer document.
To do this, go to the `Insert` tab, insert a file and then click on `Next` to move on to the indexing stage.

In the indexing form, select the `DocumentClient` class and enter a value for the `ReferenceClient` tag (e.g. _1234_).

<br/>
Next, go to the admin console and create a `ClientFolder` virtual folder class :

* Open the `Components > Virtual folder classes` section,
* Select the `ClientFolder` virtual folder class,
* Click on the `Create an instance` button.

In the indexing form, enter the following information:

* a name for the client folder,
* the value previously entered for the `ClientReference` tag of the document created.

Then click on `Create`.

<br/>
Your first job file has been created!
To validate the data model you have created, open the customer folder you have created and check that it contains the added document.

__Resources__:

To facilitate client management between the virtual folder and the documents, use the [plugin to link one component to another](broken-link.md).
