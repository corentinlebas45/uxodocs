Using the client file as an example, we can test the setting up of a practical example.

<br/>

# The client reference

In this example, the client reference is the pivot tag used to make the link between a client file and its contents.
To begin, create a string `ClientReference` tag class.

To do this, follow the steps below:

* Go to the admin console,
* Open the `Components > Tag classes` section,
* Click on the `+` button to start creation,
* Select the value type `Character string` then go on to the next step,
* In the form displayed, enter the `ReferenceClient` value as the identifier for this tag class,
* Click on `Create`.

Congratulations! You have created the `ClientReference` tag class, which will be used to classify a client's documents within the same folder.

# The client folder

To create instances of client folders, you need to create the virtual folder class `ClientFolder` referencing the `ClientReference` tag class.

To do this, follow the steps below:

* Go to the admin console,
* Open the `Components > Virtual folder classes` section,
* Click on the `+` button to start creation,
*  Click on the + button to start creation, In the form displayed, enter the `ClientFolder` value as the class identifier, and select `Security Total Control` as the Security value,
* In the `Tags` tab, click the `Add` button and select the `ClientReference` tag class,
* In the `Search` tab, click `Filters` then `Add` to initiate a new search to link the documents,
* Check that there is an identifier for the search
* Indicate 10 results to be displayed in `Display > Number of results`
* Add a search criterion with the `ClientReference` identifier as its name, the `EQUALS_TO` operator and the variable `${tags.ReferenceClient}` as its value, 
* Finally, click `Create`.


# Client documents

In order to create instances of client documents, it is necessary to create the `ClientDocument` document class .

To do this, follow the steps below:

* Go to the admin console,
* Open the `Components > Document classes` section,
* Click on the `+` button to start creation,
* In the form displayed, enter the `ClientDocument` value as the identifier for this class and `Security Total control` as the Security value,
* In the `Tags` tab, click the `Add` button and select the `ClientReference` tag class,
* Finally, click `Create`.
