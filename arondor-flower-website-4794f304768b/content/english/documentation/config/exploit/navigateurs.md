# Qualified browsers

Qualified browsers are tested and validated by Arondor for each product release. We do not rule out the possibility of anomalies on these qualified browsers, but the risk is minimal and restricted to particular or specific cases.


<br/>
__List of qualified navigators:__ 

* Chrome 88
* Mozilla FireFox 85
* Microsoft Edge 88

<br/>
*Arondor undertakes to qualify the latest version of these browsers no later than 6 months after their release.*


# Supported browsers

Supported browsers correspond to those in which the application is deemed functional. As some browsers are released at a very fast rate, Arondor cannot fully qualify all browser/version combinations for each release. However, the vast majority of intermediate browser versions allow normal use of the application. Browser troubleshooting is covered by standard product support.

<br/>
__List of supported browsers:__ 

* Chrome 58+
* Mozilla FireFox 53+
* Microsoft Edge 16+
* Safari for iOS 11+

<br/>
*Browsers not listed above are not supported as part of standard product support. Extended support for a particular browser version can be considered on a case-by-case basis.*

* For user comfort, performance and visual rendering, we recommend the use of a recent HTML 5-compliant web browser.
* Browser anomalies linked to non-compliance with standards (HTML, JavaScript, etc.) are not covered by product support. A version upgrade of the browsers concerned is recommended.
