# Endpoints
-----

*Available endpoints are listed in the `/actuator` path* 

| Endpoint                 | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
|`info`|Application information (name and version)|
|`health`|Application health |
|`env`|Application properties|
|`caches`|Management of used caches|
|`loggers`|Log configuration|
|`logfile`|Downloading the log file|
|`status`|Application health status (`UP` or `DOWN`)|

These endpoints can be disabled by adding a parameter such as: 

```properties
management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude=caches,env
```


# Security
-----

By default, endpoints described, excepted `status`, require *Basic* authentication and the `SYSTEM_ADMIN` role for each application exposing these endpoints. It is also possible to provide a FlowerDocs authentication token for a user with the `SYSTEM_ADMIN` role.


The `status` endpoint is the only one that doesn't requires authentication

<br>
The security of these endpoints can be disabled by adding the `actuator.secured=false` parameter.
