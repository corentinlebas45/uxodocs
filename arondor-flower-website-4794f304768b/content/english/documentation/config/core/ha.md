# Activation

A FlowerDocs stack made up of several instances requires certain data to be synchronized in order to function at both the FlowerDocs Core and FlowerDocs GUI levels.
To achieve this, FlowerDocs uses the [Redis] key-value database (https://redis.io/) to manage: 


* session persistence between different GUI instances
* a distributed cache for maintaining component reservations
* renewal of "static" caches (component classes, ACLs, GUI configurations, etc.) between the various FlowerDocs Core and FlowerDocs GUI instances
* persistence and distribution of asynchronous ``OperationHandler`` 

<br/>
This database offers high performance as the data is stored in memory. 


:::info
To activate this connector, you need to add the `redis.enabled=true` property.

# Access

Depending on the architecture chosen, the configuration for accessing Redis needs to be adapted. 


## Simple

This communication mode allows the use of a single Redis instance. This can be configured by specifying the `spring.redis.host` and `spring.redis.port` properties.

<br/>
__Note:__ *This type of configuration is not recommended for a production environment.*


## Sentinel 
The [Redis Sentinel](https://redis.io/topics/sentinel) mode enables Redis to be set up in high-availability mode.
This mode is activated by entering the name of the Redis master via the `spring.redis.sentinel.master` property, and the set of Redis nodes via `spring.redis.sentinel.nodes` (list of *host:port* separated by commas).   
 
## Configuration


The properties listed below are used to configure communication with Redis.

| Property                       | Description                                                                                                             |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
|spring.redis.password            | Password                             |
|spring.redis.timeout 	          | Timeout for Redis exchanges          |
|spring.redis.database	          | Redis database index         |
|spring.redis.timeout             | Maximum connection time               |

:::info 

* It is recommended to follow [Redis recommendations](https://redis.io/topics/security) to guarantee the security of this component.
* Setting up an encrypted tunnel between FlowerDocs and Redis can be done with the [spiped](http://www.tarsnap.com/spiped.html) utility as [indicated by Redis](https://redis.io/topics/encryption).
