# Content security policy (CSP) and HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

To protect against attacks, FlowerDocs sets the `Content security policy` mechanism to the default value of `frame-ancestors 'self'` and the `HTTP Strict Transport Security` mechanism to a default maximum duration of `10 minutes`. However, these values can be changed using the following parameters:

* CSP: `gui.content.security.policy`
* HTS max-age: `gui.hsts.max.age`
