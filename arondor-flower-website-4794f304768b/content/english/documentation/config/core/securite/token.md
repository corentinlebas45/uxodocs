# User token

A FlowerDocs client, such as FlowerDocs GUI, requires authentication to communicate with FlowerDocs Core.
This authentication is submitted in the form of a _JWT_ token. 

<br/>
A token is generated by FlowerDocs Core and is signed using an HMAC calculated from the SHA-256 hashing algorithm and a secret key.

Each time a request is received, FlowerDocs Core validates the token supplied with the secret key.


<br/>

By default, this secret key is randomly generated (32 characters long) at FlowerDocs Core startup. It is advisable to define it in the `core.properties` file using the `token.key` parameter.

<br/>

A token is valid for 3600s (60 minutes) from the moment it is generated. To change this validity period, the 
`token.expiration.time` parameter (*duration in seconds*) can be defined at the FlowerDocs Core level.



<br/>
In some cases, it may be necessary to include the password of the account used in the generated token. This configuration can be activated using the following parameters: 

* Inclusion: `token.password.include` (default value `false`)
* Passphrase: `token.password.passphrase`
* Iv: `token.password.iv` 



:::info
The token lifetime must be longer than the user session lifetime, which can be set using ``gui.session.timeout`` (seconds - default value ``1800``)
