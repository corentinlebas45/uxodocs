# Component identifiers

By default, component identifiers are generated in UUID (2^128) format when they are created.

When injecting components via WS, the identifiers supplied as input are, by default, overloaded in favor of UUIDs generated by FlowerDocs Core. This behavior can be modified by adding the ``id.generate.force`` property with the ``false`` value.

This property can be used to force FlowerDocs Core to use identifiers supplied as input (by a business IS, for example). This can be useful when migrating or recovering data.



FlowerDocs can generate two different types of identifier: 

* UUID (default)
* Digital (not recommended for production environments)

To change the default configuration, set the ``id.generate.type`` property to ``UUID`` or ``Numeric``.
