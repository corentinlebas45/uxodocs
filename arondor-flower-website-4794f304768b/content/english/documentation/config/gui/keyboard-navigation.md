# Accessibility 
To improve the accessibility of FlowerDocs and meet [RGAA] requirements (https://design.numerique.gouv.fr/accessibilite-numerique/rgaa/), keyboard navigation in FlowerDocs has been improved.

A menu has been set up to make it easier to navigate FlowerDocs. It allows a user to reduce the number of **Tabs** needed to reach a point of interest on the current page.  This menu is called the Accessibility Menu.

# Accessibility menu

## Open
The accessibility menu is opened using the following keyboard shortcut: **Ctrl + Alt + N**

This shortcut can be accessed from any part of the FlowerDocs application.

## Navigation
Once the menu is open, use the tab key and the Enter key to choose the region you want to move to from the list.  

:::info 
The list of choices in the menu varies according to the current page and the regions it contains.
