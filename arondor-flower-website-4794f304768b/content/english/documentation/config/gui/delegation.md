This feature enables users to delegate their work during an absence.


# Principle

A delegation is defined by:

- the user on leave
- the delegate
- the vacation period
- a description (optional)

All users access the delegation functionality via the Avatar menu and can create delegations. They also have access to the delegations given to them.

Administrators with the `DELEGATION_MANAGER` team can also create/modify or delete delegations via the administration interface.

# How it works

During the defined period, the authorizations of the user on leave are added to those of the delegate:

- access to searches and menus
- access to tasks and documents

All this is necessary to enable the delegate to carry out the absent person ' s work , even if the delegate does not normally have the necessary rights.

In the history, it is always the user who actually performed the action who is recorded.

:::warning
If an administrator user delegates to a non-administrator user, the latter will access the administration interface during this period.
