# Stored searches

:::info
It is possible to save a configured search from the user interface.
:::


When a user consults a search, he or she can save it for easier access later. This can be useful in the case of a recurring search, where the user has modified the criteria to better match their regular needs.
Once a search has been saved, the user can retrieve it in the tab `Stored searches`.


<br/>
FlowerDocs lets you save a search with empty criteria, for example, to keep criteria in memory.


# Shared searches

:::info
A user can share a saved search with other collaborators.
:::

When a user consults one of his saved searches, he can share it with other collaborators.
It is possible to share a search with a user, a group or a team.
Collaborators to whom the search has been shared can find it again in their `Shared searches` tab.
