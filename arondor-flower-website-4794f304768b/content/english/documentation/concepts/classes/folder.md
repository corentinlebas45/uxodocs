:::info
Unlike virtual folders, which are made up of searches that dynamically find components, folders have a physical model through a parent-child relationship with the components they contain. 

<br/>

A folder class defines the folder model to be created. Its specificity is the notion of the child. 

:::

<br />

# Children

The folder class defines which child classes it is authorised to contain. 
As many as possible can be defined. If you need to contain all the classes of a component type, for example, all the documents, you can add a child with the identifier `*` as follows: 

```xml 
<ns2:children category="DOCUMENT">
		<id>*</id>
</ns2:children>
```
