A tag referenced to a component class can be characterized by the following parameters:

* Mandatory: indicates whether a value is mandatory for validation
* Technical: indicates whether the user has access to this tag 
* Read-only: indicates whether or not the user can modify the tag value
* Multivalued: indicates whether or not the tag can have several values
* Default value: the default value when the tag is not filled in
* A validation mask (regular expression): if defined, overrides the one defined in the tag class
* Display order
* A description to display a tooltip

:::info
	The default value is set by FlowerDocs Core only at the time of creation: if the tag value is emptied, the default value will not be set.<br/>
	On creation, the default value is set if the tag is non-mandatory and not present. If it is non-mandatory with an empty value, then the empty value is set.<br/>
	On the GUI side, the default value is set when the component creation form is opened.

# Default value 
Default values are only valid at creation: if the tag value is empty, the default value will not be set. 

Variables can be used as default values:

* ``${dayDate}``: the current date
* ``${user.id}``: the identifier of the connected user
