 #1. __Hiding configuration within applications__ 

 The `displayConfiguration` parameter can be used to configure whether or not this action is displayed in the various Microsoft applications. By default, the action is hidden in the banner. To display it, enter the value `1` for this parameter.  

#2. __A confirmation popup appears to let you know whether to update or create a new document__

All files exported or imported using FlowerDocs Companion are stored temporarily in the directory `../Companion/temp`. If this popup appears when importing a new file, a file with the same name already exists in this directory. This directory is emptied when FlowerDocs Companion is switched off.
