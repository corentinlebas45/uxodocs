# Access to FlowerDocs

To inject Fast2 documents into FlowerDocs, you need to : 

* add a task to the map ``FlowerDocInjector``
* define the ``flowerDocConnectionProvider`` property with a ``FlowerDocConnectionProvider`` class object, then the properties: 
 
  * ``login``, the service account identifier used to authenticate to FlowerDocs
  * ``password``, the service account password used to authenticate to FlowerDocs
  * ``scope``, the identifier of the scope into which the documents are to be injected
  * ``endPoint``, the URL used to access FlowerDocs web services (example: http://localhost:8080/flower-docs-ws/services)
* define a property ``propertyHelper`` with a class object ``com.arondor.fast2p8.flower.docs.PropertyHelper`` 


# Ignore certain properties
 
When integrating this task into a Fast2 process, documents may not be injected because they have a tag that is not referenced in the document class.

In fact, FlowerDocs refuses the creation of documents that are not valide. If these non-referenced tags are introduced by technical properties used in the Fast2 process, it is possible to exclude certain properties during the injection process. To do this, edit the ``ignoredData`` property.
