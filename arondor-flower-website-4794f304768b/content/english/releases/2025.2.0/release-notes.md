# Overview

FlowerDocs **2025.2.0** enhances the reporting experience with a more intuitive design and strengthens integration capabilities through the introduction of a dedicated Java REST client. This new client simplifies and accelerates API integrations while marking the official deprecation of the SOAP API. The release also includes important fixes and security improvements (CVEs), reinforcing stability and reliability in production.


# Upgrade Notes

You can find out about the major technical changes in this version by consulting the upgrade notes [here](broken-link.md)

# For Functional Users


Version **2025.2.0** brings several enhancements to make reports clearer and more convenient to use. The action `Create your dashlet` has been renamed to `Create a report` for better clarity.

Reports can now be displayed in full screen for improved visibility.

In addition, when users click on the title of one of their personal reports, they are redirected to the search screen used to build the report, making it easier to access the information they need.

These changes are only the beginning: **further improvements to reports are planned for upcoming versions** to continue enhancing the user experience.

We encourage our users to **share their use cases, needs, or ideas, and to vote on our [product portal](https://portal.productboard.com/xm7hyfq2qsh4iq5go1hqbc7g)** to help us shape the next evolutions

This new version of the viewer offers enhanced security following the correction of several CVEs.


The user creation or update screen now clearly highlights all required fields. The "Create" or “Save” button will remain inactive until all mandatory fields are completed.

# For integrators


With version **2025.2.0**, FlowerDocs introduces a **dedicated Java client library** to simplify and accelerate integration with our REST APIs. This client provides typed models, utility methods, and centralized handling of authentication and errors. It significantly enhances the developer experience, reduces maintenance effort during API evolutions, and ensures consistent usage across projects.

Compared to SOAP, REST is **lighter, more standardized, and widely adopted in modern ecosystems**. It integrates more easily with today’s frameworks, enables faster exchanges with simple formats like JSON, and reduces the technical complexity of integrations.

Ideal for partners and integrators building middleware or custom automations, this REST client shortens time-to-integration while providing a reliable, standardized foundation.

:::info
Starting with this version, **the SOAP API and its associated Java client are deprecated**. We strongly encourage our partners and clients to plan their migration to the Java REST client to benefit from improved performance, simplified maintenance, and stronger compatibility with modern standards, by following the upgrade notes [here](broken-link.md)
:::


New REST endpoints are available:

* to create or retrieve annotations in json format instead of XFDF format in order to facilitate these actions via APIs  
* to manipulate reservations by providing a list of component references  
* to retrieve a token with an expiry date

See details in the upgrade notes: [here](broken-link.md)


To view all the groups to which a user is entitled, even if they are nested in the directory, you need to activate the user.groups.resolve-recursively=true property in the core.properties file. It is no longer possible to activate this property via the administration GUI.


# For operators


Several CVEs have been addressed in this version. Specific details are withheld to protect against exploit attempts.
