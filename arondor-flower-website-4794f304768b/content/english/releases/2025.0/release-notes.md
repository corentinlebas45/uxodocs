# Overview

Version 2025.0 brings significant improvements in terms of performance and usability. Highlights include a new version of the ARender viewer, more intuitive versioning, improvements to serial processing so that it can be used with both self-assigned and non-assigned tasks, and the ability to submit ideas directly from FlowerDocs to develop the product with our users.

# Upgrade Notes

You can find out about the major technical changes in this version by consulting the upgrade notes [here](broken-link.md)

# For Functional Users


The performance of FlowerDocs has been optimised to ensure that it runs smoothly, whatever the volume of documents, tasks and files or the complexity of the data model. In a test with 100 simultaneous users and 1,000,000 documents and tasks, the time taken for one user to complete the scenario was halved.
To find out more, read the upgrade notes [here](broken-link.md)


This new version of the viewer brings significant ergonomic improvements and enhanced security.

* **Quick menu at text selection**: When a text is selected, a quick menu appears below the selected text, allowing the user to copy, highlight and underline, making interaction with documents quicker and more efficient.

* **The toolbar has been simplified and grouped together for a more user-friendly experience.** Annotations and buttons are neatly organised in productivity-enhancing submenus.

* **Optimized navigation within documents displayed in the viewer.**

It is now possible to display all pages, only the first page or only the title for open.

or navigate through documents using a list.

* The redact menu (beta feature) has been moved to the left to make it easier to create and view strikethroughs.

To take full advantage of our knowledge of annotation ergonomics, FlowerDocs uses the standard viewer configuration for annotations, including the default colors used.
It is possible to modify certain standard configurations by following the documentation presented [here](broken-link.md)


Page rotation management has been optimized for more efficient processing. In this new version, a user does not need to have annotation rights to save a page rotation. By default, as soon as a user has the right to consult a document, he or she has the right to rotate misaligned pages, and any changes made are automatically saved. 
üõ†Ô∏è Technical details :   
Create a new ACL: acl-rotation, which is applied to all rotation annotations. To find out more, see the upgrade notes: [here](broken-link.md)


The display of versions has been modified in the document history and for version consultation, to offer a more efficient user experience.
Earlier versions now have a new blue icon to identify them more quickly in history.
{{< img src="/img/release-notes/Version_PopUpHistoriqueVersions_EN.png">}}
Consultation of a previous version is carried out in a new tab, in which the proposed actions have been redesigned to offer the functionalities applicable to a version, including comparison with the working version.
{{< img src="/img/release-notes/Version_Consultation_EN.png">}}


Search has been improved by homogenizing search menu labels and modifying the text extraction engine for full-text search.
FlowerDocs uses the extraction engine provided by ARender instead of the Tika library to guarantee better performance, particularly for the maximum number of characters extracted: our tests went up to 5 million characters.
The zip export function for all documents returned as search results has been removed for performance and usability reasons. It is still possible to export the content of documents returned as results by selecting the desired ones.


Users can index documents or process jobs from a results table, gaining efficiency through serial processing. Actions follow on from one another, without having to return to the search result or processing table.

For further information, please consult the documentation [here](broken-link.md)


Thanks to the integration of an ideas portal within FlowerDocs, each user can submit the evolutions they would like to see in the product to the Uxopian Software team. This provides valuable information for prioritizing and proposing new features and significant improvements for all users.
{{< img src="/img/release-notes/PortailId√©es_EN.png">}}


The latest version of FlowerDocs continues on its path towards compatibility with WCAG 1 level A and RGAA accessibility standards. Emphasis has been placed on administration, search and menu navigation for this release.
To facilitate access to the accessibility declaration, this has been moved to the "Product information" menu.

# For Integrators

<span style="color: #FF0000"> **SOAP APIs are deprecated from this version onwards, and you must use the REST APIs offered by FlowerDocs.**</span>


Swagger can be accessed via a new URL: /core/swagger-ui/index.html, the old URL: /core/swagger-ui.html is no longer available.


Generation of a flowerdocs-starter client containing all the Java libraries needed for development. To take advantage of this, you need to update your application pom.


Permission management has been simplified for the following elements:

* The READ_OBFUSCATION permission (View obfuscations) is deprecated, only the OBFUSCATE permission (Create and view obfuscations) is used.
* To update the content of a document, you must explicitly have the UPDATE_CONTENT right. The combination ADD_CONTENT and DELETE_CONTENT is deprecated, and will no longer give you the right to modify content.


The Nashorn JavaScript engine is replaced by GraalJS. To find out more, see the upgrade note [here](broken-link.md)


Two new APIs are available:

* Rename the file name associated with a document: `/core/rest/documents/{id}/files/{fileId}/name`  
* To send, retrieve or delete the textual content of a document in FlowerDocs: `/core/rest/documents/{id}/files/{file}/content/index`


* API WS: Document modification or deletion services return an exception if the identifier indicated does not correspond to the identifier of the current version of the document. 
* API WS: A new WS REST is available to retrieve a specific version of a document: `/core/rest/documents/{documentId}/versions/{versionId}`  
* API JS: The registerForComponentChange method is no longer called when a version is opened, so that actions can only be taken when the document is opened.

## Removed features


# For operators


The ARender GUI is now an application in its own right, and is no longer embedded in FlowerDocs GUI. To find out more, see the upgrade notes [here](broken-link.md)


Delete unused OpenSearch indices: 

* \*-flower-docs-content  
* \*-flower-docs-version

To find out more, see the upgrade notes [here](broken-link.md)


FlowerDocs supports the RFC 2183 standard for the Content-Disposition header, allowing better management of accented characters.
