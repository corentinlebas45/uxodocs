# 🚀 Welcome to **uxopian-ai**

**uxopian-ai** is a complete, standalone framework designed to accelerate and simplify the integration of powerful AI features into any enterprise application.

Built on a solid foundation of **Java 21 LTS** and **Spring 3.5**, it goes far beyond a simple library by providing a full suite of tools — from backend services to frontend components — to create sophisticated, reliable, and scalable AI solutions.

## ✨ The uxopian-ai Advantage: _More Than Just a Library_

While **uxopian-ai** uses the excellent **Langchain4j** library as its core for LLM interactions, it builds a complete enterprise-ready ecosystem around it. Here’s the added value:

✅ **Standalone Service, Not Just Code**
A pre-packaged, deployable service that saves you months of development and infrastructure setup.

✅ **Ready-to-Use UI Components**
Instantly integrate AI with web-components (IIFE compiled, scoped CSS), plus plug-and-play integration scripts.

✅ **Advanced Orchestration Engine**
The unique **Goal** system enables dynamic prompt selection based on context — no need to build this from scratch.

✅ **Complete Conversation Management**
Persistent conversations with cost tracking, response regeneration, and user feedback support.

✅ **Simplified Extensibility**
Easily add custom LLM connectors or template helpers through a clean, plugin-style architecture.
