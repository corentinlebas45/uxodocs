# Installation overview

The installation guides cover deploying the ARender rendition backend on your own infrastructure for production use.

## Before you start

These guides assume the React viewer is already embedded in your application. If not, follow [Getting Started](../quickstart/getting-started.md), then return here.

You also need access to the repositories that host the ARender artifacts. [Repository access](./repository-access.md) lists the channels — Cloudsmith for binaries and Maven libraries, Artifactory for Docker images — and how to request credentials.


## Choose your deployment path

The [Docker Compose](./docker-compose.md) guide covers single-server deployments with Nginx as a reverse proxy.

## What each guide covers

Each deployment guide is self-contained and walks through:

1. Deploying the rendition backend
2. Setting up the reverse proxy to connect your application to the backend
3. Configuring authorized document sources
4. Verifying the installation

For OAuth2 and BFF authentication, see [Advanced configuration](./configuration.md) after completing your chosen guide.
