## Important

### Regression

The Docker images for Alfresco and FileNet in version 2023.14.0 are missing their respective connector JAR file inside the container:

- Alfresco: **artifactory.arondor.cloud/arender-ui-springboot:2023.14.0-alfresco**
- FileNet: **artifactory.arondor.cloud/arender-ui-springboot:2023.14.0-filenet**

#### Workaround

To restore proper functioning, manually add the requred connector JAR to the container:

- Alfresco connector, download [here](https://artifactory.arondor.cloud/artifactory/arondor-all/com/arondor/arender/arondor-arender-cmis/2023.14.0/arondor-arender-cmis-2023.14.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar).
- FileNet connector, download [here](https://artifactory.arondor.cloud/artifactory/arondor-all/com/arondor/arender/arondor-arender-filenet-ce/2023.14.0/arondor-arender-filenet-ce-2023.14.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar).

Mount the JAR into the container at the following path **/home/arender/lib**
