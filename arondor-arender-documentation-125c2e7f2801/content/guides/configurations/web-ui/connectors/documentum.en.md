- Uploading of contents from an URL or from a local machine,
- Saving as PDF, with or without annotations
- Printing the document, with or without annotations
- Viewing EMC Documentum virtual documents,
- Annotating through text (sticky notes) and/or graphical (highlight,
  etc...) features documents by linking and archiving them in a
