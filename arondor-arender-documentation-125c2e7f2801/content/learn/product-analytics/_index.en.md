## What is Product Analytics in ARender?

Since version 2023.5.0, ARender has included a Product Analytics feature powered by Mixpanel, enabling the Uxopian team 
to better understand how ARender is used in real-world scenarios. This feature is activated by default and can be easily
disabled by configuring a simple parameter following the ARender configuration guide.

With this setup, users can rest assured that their sensitive information remains private and secure.

* Understand how features are being utilized.

* Identify pain points or underused functionalities.

* Prioritize future updates and improvements.

This feature is designed with user safety and privacy in mind, ensuring that no sensitive document data is ever exposed.
By using Product Analytics, ARender becomes a smarter, more focused tool that better serves its users.
