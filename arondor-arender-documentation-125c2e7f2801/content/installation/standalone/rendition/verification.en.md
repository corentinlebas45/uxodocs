Once the server is starting, you can check the URL
<http://renditionServerHost:8761/health/records>
to see status services (please replace "renditionServerHost" with your actual *hostname* on which
the rendition server is running).


All services must be visible, started, and functional.

It may happen that not all services appear when rendition does not
still completely started, in this case you have to wait a few minutes.

If some services or features are incomplete or not started,
thank you kindly check [the prerequisites of the rendition](/installation/standalone/rendition/requirements/).
