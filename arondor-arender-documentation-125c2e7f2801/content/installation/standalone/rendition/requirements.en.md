| :------------------- | :--------: | :--------------------: |
| Service broker       | HTTP/HTTPS |                   8761 |

| Java Runtime                    | JRE 1.8 64 bits Minimum, OpenJDK 11 advised. Oracle JDK are supported, JRE IBM J9 is unsupported.                                                         |

If the JVM used is not **64 bits**, the rendition will now stop its boot and
warn in the logs/console that the version of the JVM used is incorrect.

## Access rights
