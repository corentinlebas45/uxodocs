The versions are formed of 3 numbers separated by dots. We therefore find an X.Y.Z pattern.

- X corresponds to the major version: changes not backward compatible. The major evolutions bring new functionalities, by radically changing the appearance or the architecture of the software.

- Y corresponds to the minor version: addition of backward compatible features, mainly bug fixes, addition of some features.

- Z is patch: backward compatible bug fixes, security vulnerabilities.
